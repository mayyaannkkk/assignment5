##  Data Update Procedure

When a new international match window or tournament concludes:

1. Return to the Kaggle dataset page and check for an updated version (the dataset maintainer updates it regularly after major tournaments).
2. Download the new CSV archive.
3. Replace `results.csv`, `goalscorers.csv`, and `shootouts.csv` in the repository with the new versions.
4. Commit and push to GitHub — Streamlit Community Cloud will automatically redeploy with the new data.

If the Kaggle dataset is no longer maintained, the same data can be sourced from:
- **football-data.co.uk** — https://www.football-data.co.uk/
- **OpenFootball GitHub** — https://github.com/openfootball/south-america
- **API alternative:** [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/) (free tier available, provides match results via REST API)
